=head1 NAME

cpanm-reporter - send cpanm output to CPAN Testers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Call cpanm as you normally would:

   > cpanm Moose Catalyst::Runtime Data::Printer ...

then, just call cpanm-reporter:

   > cpanm-reporter

=head2 OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS

   --build_dir=PATH       Where your build directory is, containing
                          each dist's subdir. Default: $HOME/.cpanm/latest-build

   --build_logfile=PATH   Where the build.log is. Default: $BUILD_DIR/build.log

   --verbose (or -v)      Extra output


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This app properly parses the output of L<cpanm> (C<build.log>) to
automatically generate and send reports to the CPAN Testers database.

C<cpanm> has quickly become one of the most used CPAN clients out there, but
it doesn't come with a native way to generate and send test reports to the
CPAN Testers infrastructure. This standalone app is able to interact with
your cpanm after you install a module, and do that for you.

=head2 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

You can use configuration files with different names and locations by setting
the following environment variables:

=over 4

=item * PERL_CPAN_REPORTER_DIR

The base directory in which your 'C<config.ini>' file resides. Defaults to
your home directory (if you're using Linux or OS X) or to the 'my documents'
folder (if you're running Windows).

=item * PERL_CPAN_REPORTER_CONFIG

In case you don't want to change just the base directory but the entire file's
path and name, you can set this variable to point at the new 'config.ini' file.

=head1 CAVEATS

=over 4

=item * cpanm currently does B<not> record the output into your build.log file
if you pass the "verbose" argument to it, either C<--verbose> or C<-v>. If
you used those when installing dists, C<cpanm-reporter> won't find anything
to send :(

=item * cpanm-reporter is an external, auxiliary tool to cpanm. Since they're
not attached, you must take care not to change perls or local-libs between
installing distributions with C<cpanm> and generating/sending the reports with
C<cpanm-reporter>. If you're not a power user, you don't have to worry about
this. Just remember to run cpanm-reporter immediately after cpanm and
everything will be fine :)
