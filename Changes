Revision history for App-cpanminus-reporter

0.07  2013-05-08
    NEW FEATURES:
      - new '--setup' option that configures and updates your CPAN Testers
        data for you, just like CPAN::Reporter does for 'cpan'!
        (this fixes RT#84799 and Github#2, thanks Maurice Mengel and Boris
         DÃ¤ppen for reporting!)

    BUG FIXES:
      - fixed RT#84979 where cpanm-reporter crashed when the build.log file
        could not be found (thanks Nathan Glenn for reporting!)
      - recommends installing Test::Reporter::Transport::Metabase as well,
        since almost all testers want to report directly to the CPAN Testers
        servers. Fixes RT#84794 (thanks Mark Lawrence for reporting!)
      - forces dependency on version 0.05 of CPAN::Testers::Common::Client,
        which fixes RT#85112 (thanks Lars for reporting!)

    OTHER:
      - updated docs :)

0.06  2013-04-18
